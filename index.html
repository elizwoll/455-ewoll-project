Adorning the walls of Rosie McCann's Irish Pub & Restaurant were hand painted signs from the young artist who values traditional hand lettering technique and exudes old school style.
<br><br>
        Merging art and function, Ballas' work is clean, simple, and approachable. His art showcases an attention to detail and honors classic craftsmanship. Not overworked nor complicated, his pieces are much more literal and still playful. With such a clear and creative point of view, Ballas is definitely an artist to keep an eye on!</p>

      The history of sign making in Santa Cruz and the greater Bay Area is a story deeply intertwined with the region’s cultural identity, artistic movements, and entrepreneurial spirit. From the quirky surf shops of the Santa Cruz boardwalk to the bustling neon glow of historic Oakland theaters, signage in this part of California has long served as both a functional necessity and a creative expression of place. Across decades, sign makers have helped shape the visual language of coastal towns and urban centers alike, turning everyday advertisements into works of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as towns like Santa Cruz and San Jose grew into commercial and transportation hubs, the need for signage blossomed. Local businesses—from saloons and soda fountains to hotels and haberdasheries—commissioned hand-painted wooden signs to hang above their doors or in storefront windows. These early signs were often created by itinerant sign painters, known for their precise brushwork and ability to design letters by eye. Their tools were simple—mahl sticks, quills, and oil-based paints—but the results were highly personal and often beautifully detailed.
    </p>
    <h2>20's and 30's</h2>
    <p>
      As the automobile age took off in the 1920s and ’30s, signage in the Bay Area evolved along with the landscape. Highway 1 and Route 17 brought tourists through Santa Cruz and up into San Francisco, prompting businesses to invest in bolder, more visible signage. Neon signage became a defining visual element of the era. In San Francisco and Oakland, massive neon marquees lit up theater districts, while Santa Cruz saw an increase in bright, glowing signs advertising seafood restaurants, motels, and boardwalk amusements. The buzz of neon became a beacon for nightlife, entertainment, and local commerce throughout the region.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Santa Cruz</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Cruz, with its strong surf and skate culture, developed a distinctive style of signage—casual, colorful, and hand-drawn. The beach-town vibe of Santa Cruz fostered a design language that was playful and bold, often influenced by comic art and DIY punk zine aesthetics.
      </div>
      <div>Local surf shops, cafes, and tattoo parlors used hand-painted signs and funky typography to set themselves apart, contributing to the eclectic character the town is known for today. Many of these businesses relied on local sign painters, some of whom developed reputations as artists in their own right.
      </p>

      <h2>Greater Bay Area</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the Bay Area, and especially in San Francisco’s Mission District and Berkeley’s Telegraph Avenue, hand lettering maintained its relevance well into the late 20th century. Sign painters played a crucial role in shaping the visual personality of the region’s independent bookstores, record shops, taquerias, and coffee houses. These hand-crafted signs told stories—not just about what was being sold, but about the communities they represented. Even as vinyl and digital printing became more widespread in the 1980s and '90s, there remained a strong grassroots movement to preserve traditional craftsmanship and analog design.
      </p>
      <h2>Today</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, that movement has only grown stronger. Across the Bay Area, a new generation of sign makers and lettering artists has emerged, blending old-school techniques with contemporary aesthetics. In Santa Cruz, businesses like Sign of the Times have become local institutions—bringing hand-painted signage back into the mainstream by celebrating its authenticity and charm. These studios not only produce signs for modern clients but also help preserve and restore historic signage, bridging the gap between eras.

    > in nearby Los Angeles have helped elevate sign making to the realm of serious design and visual history. Local workshops, lettering classes, and public art initiatives have brought renewed appreciation for the hand-drawn letter and the artisan behind it. Even in the tech-driven heart of Silicon Valley, there's growing recognition that something handcrafted—especially in signage—carries emotional and cultural weight that digital design often lacks.
      Today, the signs of Santa Cruz and the Bay Area are more than just directions or advertisements—they’re icons of place, memory, and identity. Whether it’s a faded ghost sign on a Mission Street wall, a retro neon diner light flickering in Oakland, or a freshly painted window in downtown Santa Cruz, each sign tells a story. These pieces of visual history remind us that even in a fast-changing world, there’s beauty in slowing down, picking up a brush, and making something that lasts.
